# About Me:
Hi. It's Seven. I'm a computer addict who wants to be an expert of everything. Such as video editer and etc. Especially programming. Programming hit my heart like a big heavy rock falling from the sky. My interest in programming began a long ago. I always wondered how softwares are developed and what are the codes mean whenever I see a bit of programming, it used to be so difficult to understand. It's easier to understand now. I have understood that everything we use in this century is programming as if we compare the years with 1950s and now. The programming has changed our world alot and it keeps changing, with this in mind programming took my interest a lot. Furthermore I wanted to be at this point of changing the world. I like doing researches alot, once something goes in my mind I'm always doing a research at maximum level until all of the question marks in my head are gone. Sometimes this takes a long time like 4-5 hours if the topic is interesting and about programming. 

# My Skills:
My interest in photoshop began after seeing cool text examples on google. I started watching tutorials. There is some photoshop stuff I made when I began photoshop in 2012 dec. - 2013 feb. (11-12 years old).

This interest helped me grow slowly at lots of points. One of these points is the video editing industry. I have joined the video editing industry when I was 13. I was doing it as a hobby by watching tutorials and now I have lots of knowledge about video editing and photoshop. I uploaded lots of videos on youtube and started getting money from it as I was editing videos for the gamers.

# Plans:
While focusing on higher education. I will try to start a new project with the people I know who has reached good goals in this industry. I will have a conversation with them and will try to be a part of a project so I can gain as much expeience as I can as these experiences will be a huge impact for my future plans. Once I finish higher education, I'm planning to do a masters degree and then the doctor's degree, as I want to be an expert in this industry.

# Experience
I had a work experience as a web developer in custard design at Eastbourne in 2019. All my experience about video editing, programming, photoshop were by my own watcihng tutorials and etc.
